# The Palimpsest Covenant

*A covenant for the Cerro Torre community*

## Preamble

A palimpsest is a manuscript page that has been scraped clean and written over, yet traces of earlier writing remain visible beneath. Like a palimpsest, our software carries the marks of all who came before us—the upstream developers, the distribution maintainers, the countless contributors whose work we build upon.

The Palimpsest Covenant acknowledges this layered history. We are not authors writing on blank pages; we are scribes adding our layer to a living document that stretches back decades and will continue long after us.

## Our Commitments

### 1. To Provenance

**We commit to honest accounting of origins.**

Every piece of software we distribute carries its full lineage. We do not obscure, we do not claim false credit, and we do not break the chain of attribution. When we modify upstream work, we document what we changed and why.

This is not merely a technical requirement—it is an ethical one. The developers who wrote this code deserve acknowledgment. The users who trust this code deserve to know its history.

### 2. To Transparency

**We commit to operating in the open.**

Our decisions, our processes, and our code are visible to all. We prefer public discussion to private channels. We document our reasoning, not just our conclusions.

When we must work in private (such as coordinating security fixes), we minimize the scope and duration. Secrets are a liability; transparency is a strength.

### 3. To Verification

**We commit to claims we can prove.**

We do not ask users to trust us—we give them tools to verify. Cryptographic signatures, reproducible builds, and auditable processes replace "trust me" with "check for yourself."

This applies to governance as well as technology. Our votes are recorded. Our finances are public. Our decisions can be traced to their origins.

### 4. To Stewardship

**We commit to long-term thinking.**

We are stewards, not owners. Our decisions must serve not only today's users but those who will come after us. We resist short-term expedients that create long-term problems.

This means saying no to dependencies that compromise security. It means choosing boring technology that will still work in ten years. It means building for succession, not permanence.

### 5. To Each Other

**We commit to treating each other with respect and good faith.**

We assume good intentions until proven otherwise. We criticize ideas, not people. We recognize that disagreement is not disloyalty.

We make space for different kinds of contribution. Not everyone writes code; not everyone speaks English as a first language; not everyone has the same time and energy to give. All sincere contributions are valued.

### 6. To Users

**We commit to putting users first.**

Users are not products, not data sources, not leverage. Their security and privacy are paramount. Their needs guide our priorities.

We do not ship code we would not run ourselves. We do not implement features that harm users to benefit ourselves or others.

### 7. To the Commons

**We commit to strengthening the broader ecosystem.**

We do not extract from open source—we contribute to it. Bug fixes go upstream. Documentation helps everyone. Our work remains open for others to build upon.

We cooperate with other distributions and projects. The supply chain security problem is too big for any one project to solve. Our success is measured partly by how much we lift others.

## Our Boundaries

The Covenant also defines what we will not do:

### We Do Not

- **Compromise security for convenience**: Security is not negotiable. If a feature cannot be implemented securely, we do not implement it.

- **Accept contributions under duress**: All contributions must be freely given. We reject pull requests from developers being coerced by employers, governments, or others.

- **Implement backdoors or surveillance**: No matter who asks. This is absolute.

- **Discriminate against users**: We do not restrict who can use our software based on nationality, politics, religion, or any other irrelevant criterion.

- **Sell influence**: Funding does not buy votes, does not buy roadmap control, does not buy exceptions to policy.

## Enforcement

The Covenant is enforced through several mechanisms:

### Self-Governance

Community members are expected to uphold these commitments and to hold each other accountable with kindness and clarity.

### Moderation

The Board may appoint moderators to handle disputes and violations. Moderators act according to published guidelines and are themselves accountable.

### Escalation

Serious or persistent violations may result in:
1. Private warning
2. Public warning
3. Temporary suspension from community spaces
4. Removal from membership
5. Permanent ban from the project

These steps are not strictly sequential—severe violations may warrant immediate action.

### Appeals

All enforcement decisions may be appealed to the Board. The Board's decision is final.

## Evolution

The Covenant is not static. As our community grows and learns, the Covenant should grow with it.

Amendments follow the same process as amendments to the Articles of Association: proposal, discussion, and supermajority vote.

## Signing

By joining the Cerro Torre community as a member, you indicate your agreement with this Covenant.

You are not signing away rights—you are affirming values we hold in common.
