# Articles of Association — Cerro Torre Cooperative

**Version:** 0.1.0 (Draft)
**Status:** Pre-formation discussion document

## Preamble

Cerro Torre is organized as a democratic cooperative to ensure that the project remains accountable to its users and contributors, rather than to venture capital or corporate interests.

The name "Cerro Torre" invokes a mountain in Patagonia known for both its beauty and the controversy over its first ascent—a reminder that how we reach our goals matters as much as reaching them.
